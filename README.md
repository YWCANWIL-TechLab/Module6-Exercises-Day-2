# Module6-Exercises-Day-2

Today we'll continue working with Conditionals and Loops by applying them to Strings and Arrays. If you are having trouble with any of these exercises, you have a couple options. To begin, try to solve the problem on paper without using code at all - just try to solve the problem. Once you know how to solve a problem, you job is only to translate that into code. You will also have access to the debugger in your browser. Link your JavaScript file to the html page, and you will be able to step through problems one step at a time. To do this, you must call your function somewhere in your JavaScript file. For example, if you are trying to debug reverseAString(string), you must call reverseAString("Whatever string you would like to test"), then reload the page.
